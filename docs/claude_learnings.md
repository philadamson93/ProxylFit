# Claude Learnings & Mistakes

Add entries here when Claude does something wrong so it doesn't repeat. This file serves as institutional memory across sessions.

---

## Format

Each entry should include:
- **What went wrong** — brief description of the mistake
- **What to do instead** — the correct approach

## Entries

<!-- Example:
- **Don't modify model.py fitting logic without checking docs/tutorial.md for expected behavior.** The kinetic model has specific parameter bounds and defaults that are validated against known datasets.
- **Always verify kinetic parameter bounds before changing fit defaults.** Incorrect bounds can cause silent fitting failures.
